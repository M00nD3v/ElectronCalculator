## Description
In this folder you will find files which are not directly needed for running **ElectronCalculator**.
**Folder structure:**
  - **AdobeXD** - contains files for Adobe XD which are used to create Wireframes and Designs **ONLY** for the UI (no code there)
  - **scss** - here you will find the *scss* files which will then get preprocessed into the folder ../electron/css.

**IMPORTANT:** If the folder *css* moves to another place and you are styling with scss, change the path in the first line (two times) in the file style.scss

## Changelog
### v0.1
  - added `.xd` file and `scss` folder structure
